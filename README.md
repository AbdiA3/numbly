My friends used to play a game so similiar with Wordle, but with numbers, even before Worlde was a thing.
The idea of the game is 2 players each pick a random 5 digit number, then the game is to guess one another's number.
For each guess a player makes the opponent gives them some hints, 2 hints to be exact.
Hints:
  
  1. The number of digits that are in the number and at the proper position
  2. The number of digits that are in the number, but not at the proper position

But here we will play against the computer.
